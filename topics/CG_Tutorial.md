## Brief Introduction
This tutorial is divided into two parts, 
the first part focuses on the introduction to graphics,
and the second part introduces some of the reserve knowledge needed 
in the process of learning computer graphics.

If you already have a good foundation in mathematics and experience in C++ development, 
you can ignore the second part.

## Part 1：Introduction To Computer Graphics

## Basic Course 
* [GAMES101](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1X7411F744?from=search&seid=17075628254082257476) 
  
&emsp;&emsp;
Most important course,one of the best introductory courses of computer graphics.

&emsp;&emsp;
You will make great progress by completing the matching homework.

&emsp;&emsp;
Maybe this [note](https://www.notion.so/GAMES101-b0e27c856cde429b8672671a54c34817) will give you a quick understanding of its content

* [GAMES102](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1NA411E7Yr?from=search&seid=15139106800053859709)

&emsp;&emsp;
This is a course about geometry, pick the lessons that interest you and watch them.

* [GAMES: Graphics And Mixed Environment Seminar](http://games-cn.org/)

&emsp;&emsp;
You can get more resources from the official website of games, such as games201 etc.

&emsp;&emsp;
using the BBS in the website and [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/), you can find most of the resources you need.


&emsp;&emsp;
However, in my opinion, for beginners, the above two courses are enough,
and then you can learn to write some small projects.

## Small Project Recommendation
* [Tiny Renderer or how OpenGL works: software rendering in 500 lines of code](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-1-Bresenham%E2%80%99s-Line-Drawing-Algorithm)

* Maybe you like the Chinese version [十天自制软渲染器](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1334498708214554624) 

## *Advanced course of computer graphics
* Siggraph, EGSR, ACM Transaction on Graphics（TOG）, TVCG 

&emsp;&emsp;
If you want to learn the most advanced knowledge, reading papers is the most universal way.

* [Computaional Conformal Geometry](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UC4y187D4?from=search&seid=7985288276527168472)

&emsp;&emsp;
This lesson is very scary, which need you to have a very solid mathematical foundation, not very recommended for beginners.

&emsp;&emsp;
But if you can learn this course well, 
there should be no course you can't accept in the field of computer graphics.

## Part 2：Preparation for learning computer graphics

## Mathematics foundation
In addition to the mathematics required for general engineering students，you'd better know a litter *Basic Topology*, *differential geometry*.

## Fundamentals of C++ programming

Computer graphics programs are usually completed by C + + or Similar programming languages,
thus, it's important to be able to use C + + .

* book: C + + Primer, Effective C + + ......

&emsp;&emsp;
For computer graphics programmer, C + + Primer is enough 

* [寒假 45 天如何自学入门C++? - 编程指北的回答 - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/435206521/answer/1634399094)

&emsp;&emsp;
You can find C + + basic course in everywhere, and for advanced courses, Jie Hou's courses are good.


* [When you don't understand an command](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)

## Environmental and Tools
* [Visual Studio](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_39548859/article/details/107170535)

&emsp;&emsp;
easy to use, kind for beginnners.

* [VScode + CMake](https://www.cnblogs.com/kensporger/p/12320622.html)

&emsp;&emsp;
Visual Studio is easy and powerful, however, if you head is solid enough and want to learn more, you can also use VScode.
It will be a terrible travel for beginners.

&emsp;&emsp;
